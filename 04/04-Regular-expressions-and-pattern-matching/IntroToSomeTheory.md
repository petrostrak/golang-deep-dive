### Introducing some theory

Every regular expression is compiled into a `recognizer` by building a generalized transition diagram called `finite automation`. A `finite automation` can be either deterministic or nondeterministic. Nondeterministic means that more than one transition out of a state can be possible for the same input. A `recognizer` is a program that takes a string `x` as input and is able to tell whether `x` is a sentence of a given language.

A `grammar` is a set of production rules for strings in a formal language. The production rules describe how to create strings from the alphabet of the language that are valid according to the syntax of the language. A `grammar` does not describe the meaning of a string or what can be done with it in whatever context - it only describes its form. What is important here is to realize that grammars are at the heart of regular expressions because without grammar, you cannot define or use a regular expression.
