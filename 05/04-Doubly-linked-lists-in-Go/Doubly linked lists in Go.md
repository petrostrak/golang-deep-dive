### Doubly linked lists in Go
A doubly linked list is one where each node keeps a pointer to the previous element on the list, as well as the next element. Thus, on a doubly linked list, the next link of the first node points to the second node, while its previous link points to `nil` (also called NULL). Analogously, the next link of the last node points to `nil`, while its previous link points to the penultimate node of the doubly linked list.
