### Queues in Go
A queue is a special kind of linked list where each new element is inserted to the head and removed from the tail of the linked list. 

The main advantage of queue is simplicity. Tou only need two functions to access a queue, which means that you have to worry about fewer things going wrong and you can implement a queue any way you want as long as you can offer support to those two functions.
