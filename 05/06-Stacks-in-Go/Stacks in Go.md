### Stacks in Go
A stack is a data structure that looks like a pile of plates. The last plate that goes on the top of the pile is the one that will be used first when you need to use a new one.

Like a queue, the main advantage of a stack is its simplicity because you only have to worry about implementing two functions in order to be able to work with a stack: adding a new node to the stack and removing a node from the stack.
