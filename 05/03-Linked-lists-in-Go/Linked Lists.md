### Linked lists in Go
A linked list is a data structure with a finete set of elements where each element uses at least two memory locations: one for storing the actual data and the other for storing a pointer that links the current element to the next one, thus creating a sequence of elements that construct the linked list.

The first element of a linked list is called the `head`, whereas the last element is often called the `tail`. The first thing that you should do when defining a linked list is to keep the head of the list in a separate variable because the head is the only thing that you have to access the entire linked list. Note that if you lose the pointer to that first node of a singly linked lost, there is no way to find it again.
