### The http.Response type
The definition of the `http.Response` which can be found in the `https://golang.org/src/net/http/response.go` file, is as fillows:
```
type Response struct {
	Status     string // e.g. "200 OK"
	StatusCode int    // e.g. 200
	Proto      string // e.g. "HTTP/1.0"
	ProtoMajor int    // e.g. 1
	ProtoMinor int    // e.g. 0

	// Header maps header keys to values. If the response had multiple
	// headers with the same key, they may be concatenated, with comma
	// delimiters.  (RFC 7230, section 3.2.2 requires that multiple headers
	// be semantically equivalent to a comma-delimited sequence.) When
	// Header values are duplicated by other fields in this struct (e.g.,
	// ContentLength, TransferEncoding, Trailer), the field values are
	// authoritative.
	//
	// Keys in the map are canonicalized (see CanonicalHeaderKey).
	Header Header

	// Body represents the response body.
	//
	// The response body is streamed on demand as the Body field
	// is read. If the network connection fails or the server
	// terminates the response, Body.Read calls return an error.
	//
	// The http Client and Transport guarantee that Body is always
	// non-nil, even on responses without a body or responses with
	// a zero-length body. It is the caller's responsibility to
	// close Body. The default HTTP client's Transport may not
	// reuse HTTP/1.x "keep-alive" TCP connections if the Body is
	// not read to completion and closed.
	//
	// The Body is automatically dechunked if the server replied
	// with a "chunked" Transfer-Encoding.
	//
	// As of Go 1.12, the Body will also implement io.Writer
	// on a successful "101 Switching Protocols" response,
	// as used by WebSockets and HTTP/2's "h2c" mode.
	Body io.ReadCloser

	// ContentLength records the length of the associated content. The
	// value -1 indicates that the length is unknown. Unless Request.Method
	// is "HEAD", values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
	// be read from Body.
	ContentLength int64

	// Contains transfer encodings from outer-most to inner-most. Value is
	// nil, means that "identity" encoding is used.
	TransferEncoding []string

	// Close records whether the header directed that the connection be
	// closed after reading Body. The value is advice for clients: neither
	// ReadResponse nor Response.Write ever closes a connection.
	Close bool

	// Uncompressed reports whether the response was sent compressed but
	// was decompressed by the http package. When true, reading from
	// Body yields the uncompressed content instead of the compressed
	// content actually set from the server, ContentLength is set to -1,
	// and the "Content-Length" and "Content-Encoding" fields are deleted
	// from the responseHeader. To get the original response from
	// the server, set Transport.DisableCompression to true.
	Uncompressed bool

	// Trailer maps trailer keys to values in the same
	// format as Header.
	//
	// The Trailer initially contains only nil values, one for
	// each key specified in the server's "Trailer" header
	// value. Those values are not added to Header.
	//
	// Trailer must not be accessed concurrently with Read calls
	// on the Body.
	//
	// After Body.Read has returned io.EOF, Trailer will contain
	// any trailer values sent by the server.
	Trailer Header

	// Request is the request that was sent to obtain this Response.
	// Request's Body is nil (having already been consumed).
	// This is only populated for Client requests.
	Request *Request

	// TLS contains information about the TLS connection on which the
	// response was received. It is nil for unencrypted responses.
	// The pointer is shared between responses and should not be
	// modified.
	TLS *tls.ConnectionState
}
```
The goal of the `http.Request` type is to represent an HTTP request that response of an HTTP request.

### The http.Request type
The purpose of the `http.Request` type is to represent an HTTP request as received by a server, or as about to be sent to a server by an HTTP client.

The `http.Request` structure type as defined in `https://golang.org/src/net/http/request.go` is as follows:
```
type Request struct {
	// Method specifies the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
	// For client requests, an empty string means GET.
	//
	// Go's HTTP client does not support sending a request with
	// the CONNECT method. See the documentation on Transport for
	// details.
	Method string

	// URL specifies either the URI being requested (for server
	// requests) or the URL to access (for client requests).
	//
	// For server requests, the URL is parsed from the URI
	// supplied on the Request-Line as stored in RequestURI.  For
	// most requests, fields other than Path and RawQuery will be
	// empty. (See RFC 7230, Section 5.3)
	//
	// For client requests, the URL's Host specifies the server to
	// connect to, while the Request's Host field optionally
	// specifies the Host header value to send in the HTTP
	// request.
	URL *url.URL

	// The protocol version for incoming server requests.
	//
	// For client requests, these fields are ignored. The HTTP
	// client code always uses either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.
	// See the docs on Transport for details.
	Proto      string // "HTTP/1.0"
	ProtoMajor int    // 1
	ProtoMinor int    // 0

	// Header contains the request header fields either received
	// by the server or to be sent by the client.
	//
	// If a server received a request with header lines,
	//
	//	Host: example.com
	//	accept-encoding: gzip, deflate
	//	Accept-Language: en-us
	//	fOO: Bar
	//	foo: two
	//
	// then
	//
	//	Header = map[string][]string{
	//		"Accept-Encoding": {"gzip, deflate"},
	//		"Accept-Language": {"en-us"},
	//		"Foo": {"Bar", "two"},
	//	}
	//
	// For incoming requests, the Host header is promoted to the
	// Request.Host field and removed from the Header map.
	//
	// HTTP defines that header names are case-insensitive. The
	// request parser implements this by using CanonicalHeaderKey,
	// making the first character and any characters following a
	// hyphen uppercase and the rest lowercase.
	//
	// For client requests, certain headers such as Content-Length
	// and Connection are automatically written when needed and
	// values in Header may be ignored. See the documentation
	// for the Request.Write method.
	Header Header

	// Body is the request's body.
	//
	// For client requests, a nil body means the request has no
	// body, such as a GET request. The HTTP Client's Transport
	// is responsible for calling the Close method.
	//
	// For server requests, the Request Body is always non-nil
	// but will return EOF immediately when no body is present.
	// The Server will close the request body. The ServeHTTP
	// Handler does not need to.
	//
	// Body must allow Read to be called concurrently with Close.
	// In particular, calling Close should unblock a Read waiting
	// for input.
	Body io.ReadCloser

	// GetBody defines an optional func to return a new copy of
	// Body. It is used for client requests when a redirect requires
	// reading the body more than once. Use of GetBody still
	// requires setting Body.
	//
	// For server requests, it is unused.
	GetBody func() (io.ReadCloser, error)

	// ContentLength records the length of the associated content.
	// The value -1 indicates that the length is unknown.
	// Values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
	// be read from Body.
	//
	// For client requests, a value of 0 with a non-nil Body is
	// also treated as unknown.
	ContentLength int64

	// TransferEncoding lists the transfer encodings from outermost to
	// innermost. An empty list denotes the "identity" encoding.
	// TransferEncoding can usually be ignored; chunked encoding is
	// automatically added and removed as necessary when sending and
	// receiving requests.
	TransferEncoding []string

	// Close indicates whether to close the connection after
	// replying to this request (for servers) or after sending this
	// request and reading its response (for clients).
	//
	// For server requests, the HTTP server handles this automatically
	// and this field is not needed by Handlers.
	//
	// For client requests, setting this field prevents re-use of
	// TCP connections between requests to the same hosts, as if
	// Transport.DisableKeepAlives were set.
	Close bool

	// For server requests, Host specifies the host on which the
	// URL is sought. For HTTP/1 (per RFC 7230, section 5.4), this
	// is either the value of the "Host" header or the host name
	// given in the URL itself. For HTTP/2, it is the value of the
	// ":authority" pseudo-header field.
	// It may be of the form "host:port". For international domain
	// names, Host may be in Punycode or Unicode form. Use
	// golang.org/x/net/idna to convert it to either format if
	// needed.
	// To prevent DNS rebinding attacks, server Handlers should
	// validate that the Host header has a value for which the
	// Handler considers itself authoritative. The included
	// ServeMux supports patterns registered to particular host
	// names and thus protects its registered Handlers.
	//
	// For client requests, Host optionally overrides the Host
	// header to send. If empty, the Request.Write method uses
	// the value of URL.Host. Host may contain an international
	// domain name.
	Host string

	// Form contains the parsed form data, including both the URL
	// field's query parameters and the PATCH, POST, or PUT form data.
	// This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores Form and uses Body instead.
	Form url.Values

	// PostForm contains the parsed form data from PATCH, POST
	// or PUT body parameters.
	//
	// This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores PostForm and uses Body instead.
	PostForm url.Values

	// MultipartForm is the parsed multipart form, including file uploads.
	// This field is only available after ParseMultipartForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores MultipartForm and uses Body instead.
	MultipartForm *multipart.Form

	// Trailer specifies additional headers that are sent after the request
	// body.
	//
	// For server requests, the Trailer map initially contains only the
	// trailer keys, with nil values. (The client declares which trailers it
	// will later send.)  While the handler is reading from Body, it must
	// not reference Trailer. After reading from Body returns EOF, Trailer
	// can be read again and will contain non-nil values, if they were sent
	// by the client.
	//
	// For client requests, Trailer must be initialized to a map containing
	// the trailer keys to later send. The values may be nil or their final
	// values. The ContentLength must be 0 or -1, to send a chunked request.
	// After the HTTP request is sent the map values can be updated while
	// the request body is read. Once the body returns EOF, the caller must
	// not mutate Trailer.
	//
	// Few HTTP clients, servers, or proxies support HTTP trailers.
	Trailer Header

	// RemoteAddr allows HTTP servers and other software to record
	// the network address that sent the request, usually for
	// logging. This field is not filled in by ReadRequest and
	// has no defined format. The HTTP server in this package
	// sets RemoteAddr to an "IP:port" address before invoking a
	// handler.
	// This field is ignored by the HTTP client.
	RemoteAddr string

	// RequestURI is the unmodified request-target of the
	// Request-Line (RFC 7230, Section 3.1.1) as sent by the client
	// to a server. Usually the URL field should be used instead.
	// It is an error to set this field in an HTTP client request.
	RequestURI string

	// TLS allows HTTP servers and other software to record
	// information about the TLS connection on which the request
	// was received. This field is not filled in by ReadRequest.
	// The HTTP server in this package sets the field for
	// TLS-enabled connections before invoking a handler;
	// otherwise it leaves the field nil.
	// This field is ignored by the HTTP client.
	TLS *tls.ConnectionState

	// Cancel is an optional channel whose closure indicates that the client
	// request should be regarded as canceled. Not all implementations of
	// RoundTripper may support Cancel.
	//
	// For server requests, this field is not applicable.
	//
	// Deprecated: Set the Request's context with NewRequestWithContext
	// instead. If a Request's Cancel field and context are both
	// set, it is undefined whether Cancel is respected.
	Cancel <-chan struct{}

	// Response is the redirect response which caused this request
	// to be created. This field is only populated during client
	// redirects.
	Response *Response

	// ctx is either the client or server context. It should only
	// be modified via copying the whole Request using WithContext.
	// It is unexported to prevent people from using Context wrong
	// and mutating the contexts held by callers of the same request.
	ctx context.Context
}
```

### The http.Transport type
The definition of the `http.Transport` structure which can be found in `https://golang.org/src/net/http/transport.go` is as follows:
```
type Transport struct {
	idleMu       sync.Mutex
	closeIdle    bool                                // user has requested to close all idle conns
	idleConn     map[connectMethodKey][]*persistConn // most recently used at end
	idleConnWait map[connectMethodKey]wantConnQueue  // waiting getConns
	idleLRU      connLRU

	reqMu       sync.Mutex
	reqCanceler map[cancelKey]func(error)

	altMu    sync.Mutex   // guards changing altProto only
	altProto atomic.Value // of nil or map[string]RoundTripper, key is URI scheme

	connsPerHostMu   sync.Mutex
	connsPerHost     map[connectMethodKey]int
	connsPerHostWait map[connectMethodKey]wantConnQueue // waiting getConns

	// Proxy specifies a function to return a proxy for a given
	// Request. If the function returns a non-nil error, the
	// request is aborted with the provided error.
	//
	// The proxy type is determined by the URL scheme. "http",
	// "https", and "socks5" are supported. If the scheme is empty,
	// "http" is assumed.
	//
	// If Proxy is nil or returns a nil *URL, no proxy is used.
	Proxy func(*Request) (*url.URL, error)

	// DialContext specifies the dial function for creating unencrypted TCP connections.
	// If DialContext is nil (and the deprecated Dial below is also nil),
	// then the transport dials using package net.
	//
	// DialContext runs concurrently with calls to RoundTrip.
	// A RoundTrip call that initiates a dial may end up using
	// a connection dialed previously when the earlier connection
	// becomes idle before the later DialContext completes.
	DialContext func(ctx context.Context, network, addr string) (net.Conn, error)

	// Dial specifies the dial function for creating unencrypted TCP connections.
	//
	// Dial runs concurrently with calls to RoundTrip.
	// A RoundTrip call that initiates a dial may end up using
	// a connection dialed previously when the earlier connection
	// becomes idle before the later Dial completes.
	//
	// Deprecated: Use DialContext instead, which allows the transport
	// to cancel dials as soon as they are no longer needed.
	// If both are set, DialContext takes priority.
	Dial func(network, addr string) (net.Conn, error)

	// DialTLSContext specifies an optional dial function for creating
	// TLS connections for non-proxied HTTPS requests.
	//
	// If DialTLSContext is nil (and the deprecated DialTLS below is also nil),
	// DialContext and TLSClientConfig are used.
	//
	// If DialTLSContext is set, the Dial and DialContext hooks are not used for HTTPS
	// requests and the TLSClientConfig and TLSHandshakeTimeout
	// are ignored. The returned net.Conn is assumed to already be
	// past the TLS handshake.
	DialTLSContext func(ctx context.Context, network, addr string) (net.Conn, error)

	// DialTLS specifies an optional dial function for creating
	// TLS connections for non-proxied HTTPS requests.
	//
	// Deprecated: Use DialTLSContext instead, which allows the transport
	// to cancel dials as soon as they are no longer needed.
	// If both are set, DialTLSContext takes priority.
	DialTLS func(network, addr string) (net.Conn, error)

	// TLSClientConfig specifies the TLS configuration to use with
	// tls.Client.
	// If nil, the default configuration is used.
	// If non-nil, HTTP/2 support may not be enabled by default.
	TLSClientConfig *tls.Config

	// TLSHandshakeTimeout specifies the maximum amount of time waiting to
	// wait for a TLS handshake. Zero means no timeout.
	TLSHandshakeTimeout time.Duration

	// DisableKeepAlives, if true, disables HTTP keep-alives and
	// will only use the connection to the server for a single
	// HTTP request.
	//
	// This is unrelated to the similarly named TCP keep-alives.
	DisableKeepAlives bool

	// DisableCompression, if true, prevents the Transport from
	// requesting compression with an "Accept-Encoding: gzip"
	// request header when the Request contains no existing
	// Accept-Encoding value. If the Transport requests gzip on
	// its own and gets a gzipped response, it's transparently
	// decoded in the Response.Body. However, if the user
	// explicitly requested gzip it is not automatically
	// uncompressed.
	DisableCompression bool

	// MaxIdleConns controls the maximum number of idle (keep-alive)
	// connections across all hosts. Zero means no limit.
	MaxIdleConns int

	// MaxIdleConnsPerHost, if non-zero, controls the maximum idle
	// (keep-alive) connections to keep per-host. If zero,
	// DefaultMaxIdleConnsPerHost is used.
	MaxIdleConnsPerHost int

	// MaxConnsPerHost optionally limits the total number of
	// connections per host, including connections in the dialing,
	// active, and idle states. On limit violation, dials will block.
	//
	// Zero means no limit.
	MaxConnsPerHost int

	// IdleConnTimeout is the maximum amount of time an idle
	// (keep-alive) connection will remain idle before closing
	// itself.
	// Zero means no limit.
	IdleConnTimeout time.Duration

	// ResponseHeaderTimeout, if non-zero, specifies the amount of
	// time to wait for a server's response headers after fully
	// writing the request (including its body, if any). This
	// time does not include the time to read the response body.
	ResponseHeaderTimeout time.Duration

	// ExpectContinueTimeout, if non-zero, specifies the amount of
	// time to wait for a server's first response headers after fully
	// writing the request headers if the request has an
	// "Expect: 100-continue" header. Zero means no timeout and
	// causes the body to be sent immediately, without
	// waiting for the server to approve.
	// This time does not include the time to send the request header.
	ExpectContinueTimeout time.Duration

	// TLSNextProto specifies how the Transport switches to an
	// alternate protocol (such as HTTP/2) after a TLS ALPN
	// protocol negotiation. If Transport dials an TLS connection
	// with a non-empty protocol name and TLSNextProto contains a
	// map entry for that key (such as "h2"), then the func is
	// called with the request's authority (such as "example.com"
	// or "example.com:1234") and the TLS connection. The function
	// must return a RoundTripper that then handles the request.
	// If TLSNextProto is not nil, HTTP/2 support is not enabled
	// automatically.
	TLSNextProto map[string]func(authority string, c *tls.Conn) RoundTripper

	// ProxyConnectHeader optionally specifies headers to send to
	// proxies during CONNECT requests.
	// To set the header dynamically, see GetProxyConnectHeader.
	ProxyConnectHeader Header

	// GetProxyConnectHeader optionally specifies a func to return
	// headers to send to proxyURL during a CONNECT request to the

	// If it returns an error, the Transport's RoundTrip fails with
	// that error. It can return (nil, nil) to not add headers.
	// If GetProxyConnectHeader is non-nil, ProxyConnectHeader is
	// ignored.
	GetProxyConnectHeader func(ctx context.Context, proxyURL *url.URL, target string) (Header, error)

	// MaxResponseHeaderBytes specifies a limit on how many
	// response bytes are allowed in the server's response
	// header.
	//
	// Zero means to use a default limit.
	MaxResponseHeaderBytes int64

	// WriteBufferSize specifies the size of the write buffer used
	// when writing to the transport.
	// If zero, a default (currently 4KB) is used.
	WriteBufferSize int

	// ReadBufferSize specifies the size of the read buffer used
	// when reading from the transport.

	h2transport        h2Transport // non-nil if http2 wired up
	tlsNextProtoWasNil bool        // whether TLSNextProto was nil when the Once fired

	// ForceAttemptHTTP2 controls whether HTTP/2 is enabled when a non-zero
	// Dial, DialTLS, or DialContext func or TLSClientConfig is provided.
	// By default, use of any those fields conservatively disables HTTP/2.
	// To use a custom dialer or TLS config and still attempt HTTP/2
	// upgrades, set this to true.
	ForceAttemptHTTP2 bool
}
```
As you can see, the `http.Transport` structure is pretty complex and contains a very large number of fienlds. The good news is that you will not need to use the `http.Transport` structure in all of the programms and that you are not required to deal with all of its fields each time that you use it.

The `http.Transport` structure implements the `http.RoundTripper` interface and supports HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP proxies. Note that `http.Transport` is pretty low-level.

### About TCP/IP
`TCP/IP` is a family of protocols that help the internet to operate. Its name comes from its two most well-know protocols: `TCP` and `IP`.
`TCP` stands for `Transmission Control Protocol`. TCP software transmits data between machines using segments, which are also called `TCP packets`. The main characteristic of TCP is that it is a reliable protocol, which means that it makes sure that a packet was delivered without needing any extra code from the programmer. If there is no proof of packet delivery, TCP resends that particular packet. Among other things, a TCP packet can be used for establishing connections, transferring data, sending acknowledgements and closing connections.

When a TCP connection is established between two machines, a full duplex virtual circuit, similar to a telephone call, is created between those two machines. The two machines constantly communicate to make sure that data is sent and received correctly. If the connection fails for some reason, the two machines will try to find the problem and report to the relevant application.

`IP` stands for `Internet Protocol`. The main characteristic of IP is that it is not a reliable protocol by nature. IP encapsulates the data that travels over the TCP/IP network because it is responsible for delivering packets from the source host to the destination host according to the IP address. IP has to find an addressing method to send a packet to its destination effectively. Although there are dedicated devices, called routers, that perform IP routing, every TCP/IP device has to perform some basic routing.

The `UDP (User Datagram Protocol)` protocol is based on IP, which means that it is also unreliable. Generally speaking, the UDP protocol is simpler that the TCP protocol, mainly because UDP is not reliable by design. As a result, UDP messages can be lost, duplicated or arrive out of order. Furthermore, packets can arrive faster than the recipient can process them. So, UDP is used when speed is more important than reliability.

### About IPv4 and IPv6
The first version of the `IP protocol` is now called `IPv4` in order to differentiate it from the
latest version of the IP protocol, which is called `IPv6`. 
The main problem with IPv4 is that it is about to run out of IP addresses, which is the main reason for creating the IPv6 protocol. This happened because an IPv4 address is represented using 32 bits only which allows a total number of 232 (4,294,967,296) different IP addresses. On the other hand, IPv6 uses 128 bits to define each one of its addresses. 
The format of an IPv4 address is 10.20.32.245 (four parts separated by dots), while the format of an IPv6 address is 3fce:1706:4523:3:150:f8ff:fe21:56cf (eight parts separated by colons).

### Reading the configuration of network interfaces
There are four core elements in a network configuration: the IP address of the interface, the network mask of the interface, the DNS servers of the machine, and the default gateway or default router of the machine. However, there is a problem here: you cannot find every piece of information using native, portable Go code. This means that there is no portable way to discover the DNS configuration and the default gateway information of a UNIX machine.

### Performing DNS lookups
DNS stands for `Domain Name System`, which relates to the way an IP address is translated into a name, such as `google.com` , and vice versa. The logic behind the DNS.go utility, which will be developed in this section, is pretty simple: if the given command-line argument is a valid IP address, the program will process it as an IP address; otherwise, it will assume that it is dealing with a hostname that needs to be translated into one or more IP addresses.

### Getting the MX records of a domain
Another very popular DNS request has to do with getting the MX records of a domain. The MX records specify the mail servers of a domain.
